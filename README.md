## <b>What is Docker? </b>

<img src="images/docker.png"/>
<ul>
    <li>Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package an application and its dependencies into a standardized unit called a container.</li>
    <li>This container can then be run consistently across different environments, providing a predictable and isolated environment for your application to run.</li>
</ul>

```s
./install-docker.sh
```
